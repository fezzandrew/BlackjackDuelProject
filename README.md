# BlackjackDuelProject
For this phase of the project I ended up almost fully reworking the game ui as well as the activities java pages.
On the UI I chose to switch from buttons to a seekbar to allow for code that is easier to read and easier to work on without
losing the flow of the current tasks, as well as allowing me to use one view for both game modes.
I have started setting up some buttons and getting them assigned to game variables and updating as they would if the rest of the game was setup.

Currently Not Working - the game itself is not there, I am still planning and figuring the best way to work with the database and work between
the activities saving player balance. I am also currently working out classes(activities) to create the deck and assign cards to a value and 
card pictures to their value.
